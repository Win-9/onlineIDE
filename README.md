This is a spring session login feature that keeps you logged in while you log out.

You can create a new project and start it, or you can continue the project you've been working on. Projects continue to be saved unless you delete them.

In the upper left corner, you can see the name of the user who is currently using the service and the name of the project being created.    
In addition, select the language of JavaScript or Python in the upper right corner to select the language you want to compile.   
If you enter the code in the middle input window and enter the 'run' button, the language is compiled and the results can be found at the bottom.

Because you use the text editor function, the text is painted in colors that are easy to see depending on the language,   
and if you enter a grammatically incorrect code, the line will display an x mark.
